# ThoughtBoard
A platform to write down your thoughts with minimal distractions.

# Calm in the Storm
The internet has become a torrent of attention-draining content; there's a need for a spot free from the addictive mechanics of social media. This platform has no follower counts, recommended content, likes, and comments.

# Who's it For?
The writer is a person who'd like to express his thoughts in a long form way.
The reader will most likely already know the writer and is curious about his thoughts.

# The Content
Due to the nature of the platform, I expect long form posts like essays. The only limitation on writers is 1 post per day.

# Payment
ThoughtBoard is ad-free, so there will be a subscription cost to share your thoughts. Accessing content is free
