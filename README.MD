# A personal blog built using Django
Truly personal, I'm the only one who can make posts, the Sign Up feature has been created, but it's commented out. This blog is a safehaven absent of competing thoughts.

# Some Feautures
Rich text editor that can upload images alongside the text, posts are listed from newest to oldest, only the author's post (I) can edit and delete posts, displays an unalterable publish date and author.

# The blog is live
It's being hosted by Render, all the necessary adjustments for launching the blog have been made on the "deployment" branch.
The database is also provided by Render, it uses PostgreSQL Version 15.
